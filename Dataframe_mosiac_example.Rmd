## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r dataframe example}
emp.data <- data.frame(
   emp_id = c (1:5), 
   emp_name = c("Rick","Dan","Michelle","Ryan","Gary"),
   salary = c(623.3,515.2,611.0,729.0,843.25), 
   
   start_date = as.Date(c("2012-01-01", "2013-09-23", "2014-11-15", "2014-05-11",
      "2015-03-27")),
   stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

print(emp.data)

#Refrencing data in the dataset:
#Selecting a row:

emp.data[1,] #select the first row

emp.data[1] #select the first column

emp.data[1,2] #select the first row followed by the value in the second column

emp.data[1,2] = 'nancy drew'

print(emp.data)


summary(emp.data)

mean(emp.data$salary)
```

```{r music data}
music = c(210, 194, 170, 110, 190, 406, 730, 290)
dim(music) = c(2, 2, 2)

dimnames(music) = list(Age = c("Old", "Young"),
                       Education = c("High", "Low"),
                       Listen = c("Classical", "Other"))

mosaicplot(music)

mosaicplot(music, col = c(hcl(240),hcl(120)), main = "Classical music")
